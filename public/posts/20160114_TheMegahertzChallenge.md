##The Megahertz Challenge: Doing Enough, With Less
I don't know what happened to it - I think someone stole it, to be honest - but I used to have a Pentium processor chip sitting on my desk, right under my middle monitor. I don't know the specs on the chip, but I'm sure that it couldn't push more than 100MHZ.

I kept it there as a reminder to never settle for code that wasn't as efficient as possible. My development workstations are so unfathomably powerful, compared to that little chip - but that doesn't absolve one from the responsibility to use that power as effectively as possible to accomplish the task at hand.

My good friend and confidant [edlinfan](https://botb.club/~edlinfan/) is an embedded systems developer, and a retro-computing enthusiast of the purest form. As a New Years' Resolution, he's taken on what he calls The Megahertz Challenge - a resolve to spend as much time as possible using hardware whose clock speeds can't be measured in gigahertz. It's a very interesting idea, [and you can read more about it here, on his blog](https://botb.club/~edlinfan/blog/posts/The%20MHz%20Challenge.html).

Inspired by this, I ran out and picked up a Rasberry Pi of my own... I'm still waiting on a few things tho show up in the mail, but I plan to do as much of my daily-driver, non-work-related computing on it as possible. I'm excited about the potential of doing some dev work on it, as well.

For me, it comes down to *doing enough, with less*. You can still do a lot and have a lot of fun under 1GHZ, and I'm looking forward to the journey.
