#hypertextual - a blogging framework to fight chickenshit minimalism

## what is this
hypertextual is the most lightweight blogging framework that I could come up with. hypertextual supports the following:

* display text in a browser
* load times so fast they'll peel the skin right off your face
* all posts are composed in your editor of choice, in Markdown
* previous / next post from blog post page
* view to show all posts from all time

hypertextual doesn't support the following:

* logging in and logging out
* a WYSIWIG editor
* comments

hypertextual doesn't support those things because honestly, you don't need them - or at least, I don't. If you need those things, they're not hard to come by in literally any other blogging platform - but I didn't want them, so I built this.

## why are you doing this
I read [Maciej Ceg≈Çowski's talk "The Website Obesity Crisis"](http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm) and it struck a chord with me. All I need to do is put words on the internet, and maybe link them together sometimes, so I built a blog framework that gives me what I need  - no more or less.

## what the hell is chickenshit minimalism
Chickenshit minimalism is defined as "technology that is aesthetically and functionally simple, but consumes an inordinate amount of clock cycles and memory to accomplish those simple tasks". Chickenshit minimalism is websites with flat UIs, three colors, and four sentences of text on a 1080p hero image; and hamburger menus, and 35 stylesheets, and 45 JavaScripts that are downloaded from an ad network every time you fire off a request; and 3 second load times.

## how do I use this
hypertextual was developed in Rails, but you don't need to be a Rails developer, or even have Rails installed, to use it. You do, however, need:

### Dependencies:

* Git
* [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)
* A tentative grasp on [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (and this can be acquired in about four minutes because it is not hard)

### To go from zero to deploy, follow these simple steps:

0. Install any dependencies and create an account at [heroku.com](http://heroku.com)
0. `git clone https://git@github.com:angrysql/hypertextual.git`
0. `cd hypertextual`
0. `heroku login`
0. `heroku keys:add`
0. `heroku create`
0. `git push heroku master`

### To make this blog your own, follow these simple steps:

* Edit `$YOUR_FOLDER/hypertextual/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`:
	0. Change the `<title>` and the `<h1>` to the name of your own blog
	0. Remove the bit about directing hatemail to [@angrysql](twitter.com/angrysql)
	0. Keep the bit about 'This blog powered by [hypertextual](github.com/angrysql/hypertextual)', if you would be so kind

### To write a blog post, follow these simple steps:

0. Create a new text file in `$YOUR_FOLDER/hypertextual/public/posts`
	* File naming convention is `YYYYMMDD_PostTitle.md`
		* Example: `20160101_HelloWorld.md`
0. Write your post in Markdown. HTML works, too.
0. `git add --all`
0. `git commit -am "yada yada yada"`
0. `git push heroku master`

See? Now that wasn't so bad, was it?
